##**Overview: Analysis of Citi Bike data from New York City and it's application to Des Moines.**
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
**After creating the analysis for New York City bike trip for all riders, I need to create a bike trip analysis for one of the key investors to convince him that a bike-sharing program in Des Moines is a solid business proposal.**

##**Analysis**
--------------

To start this analysis, I needed to understand the 5W's so I can tailor my analysis to the investor. I also needed to explain the advantages and disadvantages of introducing the bikesharing program in Des Moines. I used Pandas to transform sections of the provided data to a suitable datatype and used the converted datatype to create a set of visualizations. These visualizations is to provide the following information:

1. Show the length of time that bikes are checked out for all riders and genders  
1. Show the number of bike trips for all riders and genders for each hour of each day of the week  
1. Show the number of bike trips for each type of user and gender for each day of the week.  
1. Finally, I added these new visualizations to two others created in the module for presentation and analysis to pitch to the investors.  

##**The deliverables of this analysis are:**
- Change Trip Duration to a Datetime Format
- Create Visualizations for the Trip Analysis
- Create a Story and Report for the Final Presentation

##**Results:**
